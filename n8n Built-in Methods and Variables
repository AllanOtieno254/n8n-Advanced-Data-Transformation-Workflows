# n8n Built-in Methods and Variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. This document serves as a reference for available methods and variables for use in expressions, with a short description of each.

## Current Node Input
These methods help in working with the input of the current node. Some methods and variables are not available in the Code node.

### Python Support
- Python can be used in the **Code** node.
- It is **not available** in expressions.

## Built-in Methods and Variables

| Method | Description | Available in Code node? |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `$binary` | Shorthand for `$input.item.binary`. Incoming binary data from a node. | ❌ |
| `$input.item` | The input item of the current node that's being processed. Refer to Item linking for more details on paired items and item linking. | ✅ |
| `$input.all()` | Returns all input items in the current node. | ✅ |
| `$input.first()` | Returns the first input item in the current node. | ✅ |
| `$input.last()` | Returns the last input item in the current node. | ✅ |
| `$input.params` | Object containing the query settings of the previous node, including operation details, result limits, and more. | ✅ |
| `$json` | Shorthand for `$input.item.json`. Incoming JSON data from a node. Refer to Data structure for details on item structure. | ✅ (when running once for each item) |
| `$input.context.noItemsLeft` | Boolean value available only when working with the **Loop Over Items** node. Indicates whether the node is still processing items. | ✅ |
