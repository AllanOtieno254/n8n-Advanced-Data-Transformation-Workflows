## Data Transformation Nodes
n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data efficiently. These nodes help in structuring and modifying data before passing it to the next step in a workflow.

### **Available Data Transformation Nodes**

- **Aggregate**: Combines separate items or parts of them and groups them into individual items.
- **Limit**: Restricts the number of items by removing those beyond a defined maximum count.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Identifies and removes duplicate items based on all fields or a subset of fields.
- **Sort**: Arranges lists in a specified order or generates a random selection.
- **Split Out**: Divides a single data item containing a list into multiple individual items.
- **Summarize**: Aggregates data similarly to Excel pivot tables, allowing for grouped data representation.

These transformation nodes allow for better data management and optimization within n8n workflows.
